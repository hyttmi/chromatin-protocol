# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** Any node can receive a signed blob, verify its ownership via cryptographic proof, store it, and replicate it to peers -- making data censorship-resistant and technically unstoppable.
**Current focus:** Phase 119 — chunked-large-files

## Current Position

Phase: 120
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 119
Last activity: 2026-04-19

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 116 | 2 | - | - |
| 117 | 2 | - | - |
| 118 | 2 | - | - |
| 119 | 3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend (from v4.0.0):**

- Phase 115 P01-P04: 108min, 13min, 8min, 26min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Previous milestone decisions archived to milestones/.

- [v4.1.0]: Phase 118 depends only on 116 (not 117) -- can parallelize with 117 if desired
- [v4.1.0]: Chunked files (119) depends on type indexing (117) for CPAR/CDAT type awareness
- [v4.1.0]: Request pipelining (120) after chunked files (119) -- primary customer is chunked downloads

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PITFALL: connection.cpp:626 has unchecked total_size in chunked reassembly -- fix in Phase 119
- PITFALL: SQLite schema versioning needed before adding group tables (Phase 116)
